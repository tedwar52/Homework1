The purpose of this project was to take the supplied website and make some improvements to make the website more accessible.

To be accessible, all users must be able to easily perceive, navigate, understand, and interact with the website. These standards not only aid those with disabilities, but they also ensure a smooth experience for users regardless of how they access the site (ie using a tablet or smartphone).

Step one was ensuring that semantic HTML elements were utilized. Semantic elements are more descriptive than usual elements like <div> or <section>. This can ease navigating through a code by making it easier to find sections. To accomplish this, I replaced some of the existing <div> tags, creating a <header>, <footer>, <nav> (navigation bar), <figure>, and <aside>.

Another step was making sure images on the website had an alt element. The purpose of these is to descripe the image in a helpful manner the actual image won't load. More specifically, the intent is not to merely describe the image, but to offer context and information that the image is intended to. For this particular website, I figured the images were more decorative fillers than anything else. For this reason, I left some of them as <alt=""> since there wasn't always a useful input. For the others, I left short descriptions of the images.

An important step for creating an accessible website is creating a descriptive title element. The title element is located in the <head> tag, and is required in all HTML websites. This element is very important for search engine optimization (SEO) and will help publish websites be found through a google search. The key is to keep it short and to the point, describing what the page is for. This website seems to be about helping people broadcast their online business, so I went with "Maximize-Your-Online-Business".

There were a few loose ends of just cleaning up the coding to ensure it was accessible. This included making sure the code was in proper order and easy navigate. It runs logically and tags are used properly. When codes are formatted properly, they are easy to edit in the future. 

After making these edits, I believe this site fits the standards of an accessible website.
